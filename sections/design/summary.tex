\section{Summary}
In the PID $\Delta t$ is integrate into the coefficients there the PID will only work on that specific speed, therefor when implementing it the speed at which it is set. The sensors need to pull at a of 6 milliseconds to make sure that the target don't jump from one to a zone that is not abjected without the sensors getting a measurement. Floating point would be nice to have for many of the calculations, as some of them might get so small that integer persion wont suffice, this could be handle my multiplying with a larger value and use that for the calculation, but float will make the code more readable. Both the PID, the Kalman filter and shooting is time sensitive, therefor a normal OS cant be used as there are no guarantee that a given task will run exactly when it is called.\addtodo{Lasse}{Det her skal skrives helt om...}
