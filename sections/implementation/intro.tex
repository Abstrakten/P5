\chapter{Implementation}\label{ch:implementation}
This chapter describes the implementation of the software components of the turret. The components are implemented based on the design in \cref{ch:design}. The components covered in this chapter are those involved in the three main processes of the turret: detection, tracking and shooting. These components include the PID controller, the Kalman filter, the custom voltage-to-distance converter described in \cref{ss:minddist}, and the scheduling of the tasks. The implementation will also cover the selection of the firmware used on the LEGO Mindstorms NXT.
