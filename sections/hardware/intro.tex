\chapter{Hardware}\label{ch:hardware}
This chapter examines the hardware that can be used when building the tower and the embedded control system. Different platforms and compatible components for embedded systems will be considered, and their limitations examined. A range of sensors will be examined in order to determine their behaviors and limitations. The chapter will also analyze actuators that can be used for the tower. The chapter will result in delimitations of possible designs.
