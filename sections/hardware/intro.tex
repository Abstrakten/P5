\chapter{Hardware}\label{ch:hardware}\label{\automlabel}
This chapter explores different challenges that arise when developing an embedded system. Different platforms and hardware for embedded systems will be considered, and their limitations examined. A range of sensors will also be examined in order to determine their behaviors and limitations. The chapter will also describe the physical structure of the turret which also acts as the tracking system (it will henceforth be referred to as "the turret"). \addtodo{Mathias}{Update?}
