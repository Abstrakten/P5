\section{Problem Statement}\label{sec:problemstatement}\label{\automlabel}
A physical version of a tower defense game consists of several different components, a track, several enemies, and towers. Enemies will move along this track, and the towers objective is to hit these enemies, when they are within a certain range. In order to hit the targets, the towers need to track the targets, and adjust their aim accordingly. For this to be possible, each tower has to contain a small embedded system, that can react to some form of sensor input. This leads to this project problem statement. \\

\textit{How does one implement a program on an embedded system, such that the system can detect, track, and react to objects passing by?}\\

It is assumed that the passing objects are moving at a high enough speed that the tower can not successfully hit it if firing immediately when it registers an object, but instead has to predict the path of the object, and adjust its aim accordingly.
