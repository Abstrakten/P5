%Motivation for embedded focus
Embedded systems have been in use for a long time. One of the earliest examples of a commercially available microprocessor-based system being the Busicom calculator, that was released in 1971 \cite{intel4004}. It was based on the Intel 4004 microprocessor. Modern embedded systems are usually based on microcontrollers, which in addition to a processor typically also include memory and input/output connections \cite{micro}. Embedded systems are used in many everyday devices, and it is estimated that more than 90 percent of today's computer systems are embedded systems~\cite{embedded_nd}. This of course means that a large part of future software engineering will be concerned with embedded systems, which is also the focus in this project.\\

%Real world application of embedded systems
One of the interesting areas in which embedded systems are in use today is tracking. Tracking is used in many different systems, such as surveillance systems and military weapons, an example being anti-air weapons \cite{phalanx}. These systems can have very high requirements for accuracy, reaction time, and integrity. This project will focus on some of the underlying challenges of building a weapon system, but on a much smaller scale.\\

%Our project idea + initiating problem
Motivation for this project is drawn from the popular genre of computer games called tower defense. The purpose of the game is to strategically position defensive towers, such that they can shoot moving targets to stop them from reaching their goal. In a physical adaption of a tower defense game, the tower will have to face challenges similar to those of a military turret.\\

This leads to the following initiating problem.
