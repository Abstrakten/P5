\chapter{Preliminary Design}\label{ch:preldesign}
This chapter will describe preliminary design ideas and techniques that can be used in a system which needs to track and hit a moving target. They will conform to the requirements listed in \cref{sec:requirements}. The preliminary design will not take into account the limitations in hardware, but rather serve as a perspective on further design and to provide a standpoint for the hardware evaluation.
