% Hvad er tower defense? Hvilken type tower defense laver vi et tÃ¥rn til? Hvad er kravene her?
Tower defense is sub-genre of the real-time strategy genre \cite{td1}. The purpose of the game is to prevent enemies from reaching a certain point on a map. This is done by placing towers, usually different types, on the map. These towers will then shoot at the enemies, killing them and granting the player currency which can be used to purchase more towers or upgrade towers already placed on the map. See \cref{towerdefimg} for an example of a tower defense game. The enemies, available towers and map varies from one game of tower defense to another. The strategy element of the game lies in the placement of the towers around the map. The player must attempt to place the correct types of towers in the most suited locations in order to stop the enemy from advancing.

Tower defense games often adopt different tower placement policies. Some games have maps with a predefined path that all enemies will follow. The player must then place their towers along this path. This is the policy used in the game seen in \cref{towerdefimg}. Other games do not have a set path, but instead rely on the player creating a maze using towers, the enemies must then navigate through the maze before they can make it to their destination. \\

This project will adopt the policy of a predefined path along which the enemies must travel. This means that the enemies will always be coming from the same direction, effectively allowing all towers to wait in the most optimal position for intercepting incoming enemies.
