\section{Problem Statement and Requirements}\label{sec:requirements}
Based on the initial problem statement, and limitations made throughout the analysis, the following problem statement for a tower in a tower defense game have been deduced.

\begin{center}\textit{How can an autonomous tower for a physical adaption of a tower defense game be developed, such that the tower can detect, track, and shoot targets passing by on a predetermined track?}\end{center}

From this problem statement a number of requirements have been formulated in order to separate the different aspects of the problem, as to allow for a better design and evaluation of the solution. These requirements are representative for any tower included in the final game. The lack of specific requirements reflects the fact that a key point of the game is to have multiple towers with different properties, and so this list of requirements reflects the most basic type of tower. \\

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \label{list:vis}A tower must be able to detect a target either through optics or by motion detection.\\
    
    \item A tower must either constantly monitor the entire observable area, cover key points, or search the observable area.\\
    
    \item A tower must be able to detect and analyze movement.\\
    
    \item A tower must be able to predict the trajectory required to hit a target.\\
    
    \item Aiming at and shooting a target must be done within a limited time frame.\\
    
    \item A tower must be autonomous, meaning that it should work isolated from other systems and without user input.
\end{enumerate}

The problem statement, along with the requirements, will be the basis for the design and implementation chapters, and the foundation on which the solution will be evaluated.


%A requirement might not be necessary for any solution to the initial problem, but be a byproduct of delimitations made in this project, such as requirement \ref{list:vis}.\\
%being a a byproduct of our delimitation that a target can only be guaranteed to be detected through these methods. If the delimitation had included that a target would emit a signal, detection could have been done on that signal as well.  % Sidste s√¶tning er forvirrende
