\section{Tracking}\label{sec:tracking}
Tracking a target is closely related to detection of a target. However, tracking requires more information, than just a single position. Tracking a moving target can be a very complicated procedure as there are many factors to consider. Examples of such factors can be the speed of the target, the direction of the target, and the speed of the tracking device.\\

Tracking systems often needs to react to changes in the velocity of the object being tracked. This reaction must be done to avoid losing sight of the target, especially if the target is moving at high speed. Part of this problem is removed in this project as the target will always remain at a constant speed while passing the tracking system, as described in \cref{targetdelim}. However, this speed may change with different targets. \\

Tracking a target can ultimately be accomplished by detecting the target as well as analyzing and reacting to its movement.
