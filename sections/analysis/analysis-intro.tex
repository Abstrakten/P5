%Describe the purpose of the analysis chapter
This chapter explores different challenges that arise when developing an embedded system. Different platforms and hardware for embedded systems will be considered, and their limitations examined. As the system is required to perform certain actions within a specified and limited time frame, some aspects of real-time systems will also be considered. Finally, the possibilities of using machine intelligence in the system is considered, along with the challenges of implementing machine intelligence in an embedded system with limited resources.

\noindent
A range of sensors will also be examined in order to determine their behaviors and limitations.
