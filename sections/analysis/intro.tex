%Describe the purpose of the analysis chapter
In order to create a physical adaptation of a tower defense game. In computer games, the towers act autonomously, and they can instantly be aware of any targets within their range. It is also trivial to aim and hit targets, which in the games is mostly done for visual appeal, and is not actually a requirement. In a physical adaptation, the towers should remain autonomous, and as such, the challenges of surveying an area for targets, aiming at, and shooting them, are more complicated. \\

The processes of a tower can be split into three parts: Detection, tracking, and shooting, which in turn can be divided further into sub-parts. This chapter examines the challenges that compose this problem.
