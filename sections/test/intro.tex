\chapter{Test and Scheduling Analysis}\label{ch:test}
This chapter describes the tests of the completed turret, with all its components implemented, described in \cref{ch:implementation}, and the real-time system components used to determine the schedulability and worst-case response time of the system. The tests are conducted in order to gain information regarding the performance of the turret such that it can be determined whether it fulfills the requirements listed in \cref{sec:requirements}.
