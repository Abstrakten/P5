The following report is written by six 5\textsuperscript{th} semester software engineering students, and is intended for a reader who is expected to be familiar with the subjects of real-time problems in embedded systems and machine intelligence. It is also expected that the reader is proficient in mathematical fields, such as linear algebra, trigonometry and calculus. \\

All sources will be cited before the sentence ends, such as it has been done in this sentence [0]. \emph{Italicized} text is used to highlight certain names, variables and terms - an example being "The \emph{derivative} term is used to...". \\

Part of the challenge of this project was to find a compatible combination of available hardware and ideas, which could solve the problem. This was done through a process of going back and forth between ideas and hardware, examining hardware and brainstorming ways of applying its properties to a solution, and later repeating the process with an altered or entirely different approach. In order to try to convey this process in the report, the design was structured in two parts, a preliminary design in \cref{ch:preldesign} and a final design in \cref{ch:design}, with the hardware examination in between at \cref{ch:hardware}. The intention is to grant the reader insight into the reasoning, at the cost of not portraying the process chronologically.\\
